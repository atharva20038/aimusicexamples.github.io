# Music Generation Samples
To understand the cultural richness and genre diversity in music generation models we conducted in-context learning experimentations for different music genre types. This link contains samples of music generation from different Music generation models for different regional and genre types along with our methodology of extracting samples and prompts associated with experimentation.

## Music Generation Models : 
1. [Udio](https://www.udio.com/)
2. [Suno](https://suno.com/create)
3. [MusicGen](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/MusicGen)
   
   We use these links as playgrounds for these models to analyse their effectiveness for text-to-music generation.
